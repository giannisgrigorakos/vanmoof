# VanMoof ðŸš²
This is the VanMoof technical challenge. You type the input word that you would like to see as a Mexican Wave, and then
you press enter. The result is an array(slice) of the individual words, and each time one proper letter has "Waved".

# How to run the program 
`go run cmd/vanmoof/main.go`
