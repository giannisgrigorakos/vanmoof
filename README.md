# VanMoof ðŸš²
This is the VanMoof technical challenge. You type the input word that you would like to see as a Mexican Wave, and then
you press enter. The result is an array(slice) of the individual words, and each time one proper letter has "Waved".

# Requirements ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Go_gopher_favicon.svg)
Golang version 1.20+ (Since they try to make every change backwards compatible I don't believe running with a previous version will cause a problem)

# How to run the program 
`go run cmd/vanmoof/main.go`
